This repository contains Python Jupyter Notebooks used to detect Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The dataset used in this study is called DDoS Evaluation Dataset (CICDDoS2019), obtained from the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity. The dataset contains thousands of synthesized DDoS attack scenarios, which are based on actual attacks that were reported in 2019. The results from this development have been used in my conference paper; hence give a citation if you are using these notebooks or results from this repository.
